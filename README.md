# Bedwars-Bot
A Bedwars Bot made for Hypixel, compatibility with Fours and Dreams modes. Has resource sharing, defense, failsafes, and requeuing. Coded in Macro / Keybind mod for 1.12.2 Liteloader + Forge. 

# Important Notes
- Even though I was NEVER banned using this bot, me publicing this code will probably lead to it's patch. This is intended to bring attention to the problem so it can be fixed. If you choose to use this and get punished, I am not responsible.
- I was always top 5 daily bedwars XP every day for MONTHS. Gained around <=7 stars a day. It was so obvious...

# Why I was NEVER banned
It isn't hard to bypass Hypixel while botting (I wish staff listened to my suggestions...):
- First, it would look at teammates at all times, making it look like a non in queue.
- Any non who sits in generator all game is obviously bad at the game. When I added resource dropping to teammates, I added a look delay. It makes the bot, in replays, look like it's on a trackpad.
- When it drops resources, it drops one at a time, not full stacks. This makes it look more legit in replays as it'll be constantly dropping resources to nearby teammates at all times. It only drops resources after it has purchased iron armor (this allows it to save for iron golems).
- It buys iron golems and eats golden apples. Have you seen a bedwars bot do that before?

P.S: I ran it 24/7. It can basically go infinitely without a ban. I stopped running it because my old PC blue-screened from running it for a month straight without any restarts.. Welp.

# Questions
### Why didn't you add PVP?
- I did add pvp. I added a function to make the bot strafe and w-tap to fight if enemies were near. It was a bit too blatant/obvious though, so I removed it. Maybe someone else could make it?
### What do the files in the "Extra Stuff" folder do?
- "Attack", "Pvp", and "Movement", is the old pvp function I added. It's kind of pieced together and unfinished, so don't bother with it. Just added it for fun, recreate it if you want.
- "Scared", and "Shout": For fun, I used to have the bot shout random lines in the start of a Bedwars game. (Shout.txt). I also had the bot, whenever it purchased iron armor, send a random message from "Scared.txt", telling it's teammates it was scared and was just going to stay at base all game. It was funny because people would actually respond to the bot.

# Getting Started
1. First, download and extract this repository.
2. Open the "Dependencies" folder, and install forge 1.12.2 if not installed already. (Make sure you have the Minecraft launcher installed).
3. Once finished installing, run the liteloader 1.12.2 installer, and click the "Extend from:" dropdown. Click 1.12.2 Forge.
4. Open the "BedwarsAFK" folder you downloaded, which is inside of the Bedwars-Bot-main folder. Open the "liteconfig" folder, the "common" folder, then the "macros" folder. Open "start.txt", and replace the IGN in quotations with your IGN. Save this file.
5. Open the Minecraft launcher. You should now have a profile in the Minecraft launcher called "release 1.12.2-LiteLoader1.12.2-1.12.2-forge..". In the top of the launcher, press on installations, then on that installation.
6. Press on "Browser" for the game directory, and select the "BedwarsAFK" folder, which is inside of the Bedwars-Bot-main folder.
7. Click save, and then run the game.

### THE BOT WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY WITHOUT THESE SETUP!

# Usage / Keybinds
- Press up-arrow to start the bot. (Bot should automatically start on server join though.)
- Press "=" to stop the bot.
- You can use 5zig to Auto-Reconnect to the server. Set the delay to 30 seconds for safety.

# FAQ
Feel free to re-code or recreate my bot. You could also recode it in different languages, I don't mind. There are a lot of things that could be improved on to make the bot even better, but I only spent 2-3 days working on it. Never bothered to update it because it was the best Bedwars bot at the time, and the ban-chance was quite literally 0%.

# Stats
My bot used to average 5+ normal KDR daily from iron golem spamming. It could usually survive for a while before dying:
